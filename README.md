# Pizza-Sales Analysis 


This project showcases my data analysis skills through a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data using Excel and MySQL. By leveraging various analytical techniques and visualization tools, I gained valuable insights into the business performance of a pizza restaurant and identified key trends in customer behavior and sales patterns.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed
* <b>Total Revenue:</b> Calculated the sum of the total price of all pizza orders to understand the overall sales performance.

* <b>Average Order Value:</b> Computed the average amount spent per order by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders, providing insights into customer spending habits.

* <b>Total Pizzas Sold:</b> Determined the total quantity of pizzas sold to assess the overall demand and popularity of different pizza options.

* <b>Total Orders:</b> Counted the total number of orders placed to understand the level of customer engagement.

* <b>Average Pizzas Per Order:</b> Calculated the average number of pizzas sold per order to identify customer preferences and order sizes.

## Visualizations Created
To gain a better understanding of the pizza sales data, I created various charts and visualizations, including:

* <b>Daily Trend for Total Orders:</b> A bar chart showcasing the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period, allowing for the identification of patterns and fluctuations in order volumes.

* <b>Hourly Trend for Total Orders:</b> A line chart illustrating the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day, helping to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.

* <b>Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:</b> A pie chart highlighting the distribution of sales across different pizza categories, offering insights into the popularity of various pizza options.

* <b>Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:</b> A pie chart representing the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes, providing an understanding of customer preferences in terms of pizza size.

* <b>Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:</b> A funnel chart presenting the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category, allowing for a comparison of sales performance among different categories.

* <b>Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:</b> A bar chart showcasing the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold, providing visibility into the most popular pizza options.

* <b>Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold:</b> A bar chart displaying the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold, enabling identification of underperforming or less popular pizza options.

## Data Analysis with MySQL 

In MySQL, I leveraged SQL queries to answer specific questions and derive insights from the pizza sales data.  I created SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order. These queries allowed me to obtain accurate and precise metrics that were essential for evaluating business performance.

Additionally, I conducted SQL queries to analyze trends in the pizza sales data. By extracting data based on time intervals, such as monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly, I was able to identify patterns and fluctuations in total orders and revenue. These trend analyses provided valuable information about peak periods, sales patterns, and customer preferences, which could be used to optimize operations and marketing strategies.

To understand the distribution of sales across different pizza categories and sizes, I created SQL queries that calculated the percentage of sales for each category and size. These queries allowed me to identify popular pizza categories and sizes.

I also queried the top-selling pizzas based on the total number of pizzas sold. By generating rankings, I could easily determine the most and least popular pizza options and make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings and promotions.

## Data Preparation and Analysis in Excel 
In Excel, I employed Power Query to correct and validate the data types, ensuring accurate and reliable analysis. Power Query allowed me to transform and cleanse the data, enabling a seamless data preparation process.

Once the data was prepared, I used pivot tables to analyze the pizza sales data. Pivot tables allowed me to summarize and aggregate the data, making it easier to derive key insights. By selecting relevant columns and applying appropriate aggregation functions, such as sum, count, and average, I calculated metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and total pizzas sold. 

To present the findings in a visually appealing manner, I created a dashboard in Excel. The dashboard included various charts and visualizations, such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, to effectively communicate the analysis results.
